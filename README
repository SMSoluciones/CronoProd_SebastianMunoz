COMPLETED JAVASCRIPT PROJECT ðŸ§ 

The intention behind this delivery was not to create a game but rather an application that our company needs.

This application serves as a stage burner by section. Within the company, we aim to install screens in all sections to keep track of the time a unit - we sell buses ðŸšŒ - spends in each section. This way, the area supervisor and operators can know how much time is being taken.

The plan is to expand this application over time, but for this final challenge, I believe it is sufficient as it stands.

How does it work?

First, enter the name of the technical operator who will be monitoring that unit. This operator does not necessarily have to be registered; it's simply for the supervisor to know who is following that specific unit.

Second, load the unit you want to manufacture, with several options available. Upon loading, the manufacturing plan changes to visualize if it is the correct unit. This unit can be replaced to choose another in case of an error.

Third, give it an assignment. The assignment is basically the internal "name" of the unit. It starts with the year and ends with the manufacturing number, e.g., 22-1254.

Fourth, load the unit. After loading, the application takes the data and redirects to the stopwatch page.

How does the stopwatch work?

It can START, STOP, RECORD IN BOX, and RESET.

Before generating a load within the section, the stopwatch records in a BOX to ensure everything is correct. When the time is loaded into the section, the next section is enabled until reaching the end. After finishing, the application redirects back to the initial page to load the next unit.
